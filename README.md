# Predicting Win/Loss for League of Legend

This project is motivated by my passion for the game League of Legend. As the game is prevalently popular, there are a lot of online sources where game-stats can be retrieved. Based on this dataset, the project is predicting whether a blue team will win a game or not (or red team losing).
